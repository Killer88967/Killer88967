> "The ITCH program is amazing and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in exploring a career in healthcare. During the program, we had the privilege of listening to and learning from many fantastic healthcare professionals. Beyond the guest speakers, one of the best experiences was the hands-on learning. I also have a mentor to guide me as I continue my education and training to become a Pediatrician. The entire program inspired me and made me feel like I have a supportive team to walk this path with. It’s important to me to learn how to be a good doctor as well as a good human and I feel like ITCH can help me do both."

> "Building African American Minds (BAAM) participated in an ITCH program model that focused on careers in the healthcare industry. Some of these careers were in the medical field and others were related to non-medical careers that were utilized to support the operation of the hospital. The impact of this program was immediate with helping students to consider the various career opportunities that were available to them. All students completed a career survey prior to the first presentation to determine their career choice. A number of students selected careers related to sports and entertainment. However, after just a few weeks of presentations, students were selecting career choices based on information received from presenters. There is one student in particular who selected a professional football player as his career choice before participating in the program. His first choice is now to become an Orthopedic Surgeon. This change in his thinking about his career choice is a powerful example of what the ITCH program provided to help him understand the various opportunities that are available to him. BAAM is grateful for the partnership with the ITCH program and look forward to what the possibilities hold for students in the future."
